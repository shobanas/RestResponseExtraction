# RestResponseExtraction
The code samples in this project use java and Rest Assured library.
The goal is to try out  Yahoo's currency exchange REST APIs.
Using the open data source 'yahoo.finance.xchange', we issue GET requests to convert currencies between two countries.
The responses are obtained in both JSON and XML and are processed via jsonPath and xmlPath libraries
